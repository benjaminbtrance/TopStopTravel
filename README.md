**What's the result of my work for this webpage?** <BR />
Group 8 made a website that displays the weather forecast, current weather, music events, and sporting events when you search for a city.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
We learned a lot about git bash commands with making branches, merging, pulls, and pushes on joint projects. We learned how to call APIs, how 
to make custom cards for informtation display, and we learned how to coalesce for this project to work. The biggest value we learned was teamwork.
We all got along pretty well together, and we collaborated with one another when any of us needed help on our assigned sections of the project.
